### Software AG generic tools
This is a collection of generic tools that can be used together with Software AG products or as standalone tools.

- [base64](base64) - This base64 encoding tool can be used to encode any character string. The string is taken from the standard input, which allows the use of any printable character regardless of the underlying command interpreter. You can use this tool with any UNIX shell or Windows Command Prompt. For example, you can encode a password that contains special characters, such as ampersand (`&`), which is hard to escape in Windows Command Prompt. You can pass the encoded passwords to the Command Central bootstrapper. Download [here](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/generic-tools/releases) for Windows.
